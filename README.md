# "Quickterm.nvim"

Quickly create a terminal that saves state on hiding.

## Requirements

Tested on neovim 0.11.0-2, though the implementation is basic enough that it should work on most versions. No additional dependencies.

## Installation

Currently only tested with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), with additional plugin manager support planned.
